# Conceptual Electron Editor

Proof-of-concept editor based on [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org) showcases interesting techniques related to Electron,
Node.js, and Web technologies. It includes a plugin architecture, macros, refined search and replace conception, cross-platform packaging, and more.

Presently, the application includes a text editor and a *multi-tenant host* used to combine several functionally independent editor applications in one Electron package using shared resources.
